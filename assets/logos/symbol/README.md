# Symbol Logos

This directory contains the isolated Jovay symbol without the accompanying text.

- `svg/` - Scalable Vector Graphics.
- `png/` - Portable Network Graphics.

## Naming Convention

File names are structured to be self-descriptive:

`[color]-[shape].ext`

- **color**: Describes the color of the symbol (e.g., `black`, `blue`, `white`).
- **shape**: Describes the background shape, if any. If there is no shape suffix, the logo has a transparent background.

**Example**: `blue-circle.svg` is the blue Jovay symbol on a circular background.
