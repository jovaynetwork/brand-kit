# Wordmark Logos

This directory contains the full Jovay logotype, which includes the symbol and the "Jovay" text.

- `svg/` - Scalable Vector Graphics. The preferred format for most digital applications.
- `png/` - Portable Network Graphics. For use when SVG is not supported.

## Naming Convention

File names are structured to be self-descriptive:

`[background]-[color]-[shape].ext`

- **background**: Describes the background color or style (e.g., `white-bg`, `black-bg`, `transparent-bg`).
- **color**: Describes the color of the logo text (e.g., `black-logo`, `white-logo`).
- **shape**: Describes the shape of the background, if any (e.g., `circle`, `rounded`, `square`).

**Example**: `white-bg-blue-logo-circle.svg` is the blue Jovay wordmark on a white circular background.
